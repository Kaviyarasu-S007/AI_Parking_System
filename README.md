## I. Introduction
The ParkSmart automatic parking system prototype addresses challenges prevalent in conventional parking systems. Urban environments often face issues like limited parking spaces and inefficiencies in manual parking processes, resulting in driver frustration and wasted time. This report aims to present a comprehensive overview of the automatic parking system prototype, emphasizing its design, functionality, and potential benefits.

## II. System Overview
The automatic parking system integrates key components to streamline parking operations. The hydraulic base is the core mechanism responsible for lifting and transporting vehicles. The RFID card system enables secure identification and retrieval of parked cars. Receiver and transmitter systems in each parking slot monitor occupancy, while a central control unit coordinates these components for efficient operations.

## III. Car Entry Process
Drivers receive RFID cards upon entering the parking facility, serving as their identification throughout the process. Tapping the RFID card on the entry RFID reader checks for available parking slots. The receiver and transmitter systems assess occupancy, updating the RFID card with the assigned slot number for an available space.

## IV. Car Parking Process
With the RFID card updated, the hydraulic base comes into action, smoothly elevating and transporting the vehicle to the assigned slot. The hydraulic base incorporates safety features like anti-collision sensors and fail-safe mechanisms, ensuring the security of parked vehicles.

## V. Car Retrieval Process
To retrieve their car, the driver taps the RFID card on the exit RFID reader. The reader communicates the assigned slot number to the central control unit, instructing the hydraulic base to navigate to the designated slot. After locating the car, the hydraulic base lifts and returns it to the driver for exit.

## VI. AI & ML Model
- **Object Detection:** Utilizes algorithms like YOLO to detect and locate cars or objects in real-time.
- **Path Planning:** Applies algorithms such as A* to determine the optimal path for the car, considering available space, obstacles, and safety.

## VII. Benefits and Advantages
- Dynamic parking optimizes space utilization in real-time.
- RFID-based card system enhances security for authorized vehicle retrieval.
- Automated system minimizes human errors and reduces the risk of accidents.

## VIII. Challenges and Future Development
- Integration of multiple systems required meticulous planning and testing.
- Scalability for larger parking lots or multi-level facilities is a consideration for future development.
- Exploring AI and ML integration for further optimization.
